## Project Overview

AIFootballPredictions aims to create a predictive model to forecast whether a football match will exceed 2.5 goals. The project is divided into four main stages:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Download and merge historical football match data from multiple European leagues.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Process the raw data to engineer features, handle missing values, and select the most relevant features.
3. **Model Training**: Train several machine learning models, perform hyperparameter tuning, and combine the best models into a voting classifier to make predictions.
4. **Making Predictions**: Use the trained models to predict outcomes for upcoming matches and generate a formatted message for sharing.

## Directory Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

```
â””â”€â”€â”€ `AIFootballPredictions`
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€ `conda`: all the conda environemnts
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€ `data`: the folder for the data
    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€â”€ `processed`
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€â”€ `raw`
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€ `models`: the folder with the saved and trained models
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€ `notebooks`: all the notebooks if any
    â””â”€â”€â”€ `scripts`: all the python scripts
            â”œâ”€â”€â”€ `data_acquisition.py`
            â”œâ”€â”€â”€ `data_preprocessing.py`
            â”œâ”€â”€â”€ `train_models.py`
            â”œâ”€â”€â”€ `acquire_next_matches.py`
            â””â”€â”€â”€ `make_predictions.py`
```


### Key Scripts

- **`data_acquisition.py`**: Downloads and merges football match data from specified leagues and seasons.
- **`data_preprocessing.py`**: Preprocesses the raw data, performs feature engineering, and selects the most relevant features.
- **`train_models.py`**: Trains machine learning models, performs hyperparameter tuning, and saves the best models.
- **`acquire_next_matches.py`**: Acquires the next football matches data, updates team names using a mapping file, and saves the results to a JSON file.
- **`make_predictions.py`**: Uses the trained models to predict outcomes for upcoming matches and formats the results into a readable txt message.

**Note**: it is suggested to avoid path error, to execute all the scripts in the root folder. 

## Setup and Installation

To set up the environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AIFootballPredictions.git
   cd AIFootballPredictions
   ```

2. Create a conda environment

   ```bash
   conda env create -f conda/aifootball_predictions.yaml
   conda activate aifootball_predictions
   ```

## Data Acquisition

To download and merge football match data, run the `data_acquisition.py` script:

```bash
python scripts/data_acquisition.py --leagues E0 I1 SP1 F1 D1 --seasons 2425 2324 2223 --raw_data_output_dir data/raw
```
This script downloads match data from [football-data.co.uk](https://www.football-data.co.uk/) for the specified leagues and seasons, merges them, and saves the results to the specified output directory.

To avoid error please see the [Supported Leagues](#supported-leagues) sections. 

## Data Preprocessing

Once the raw data is downloaded, preprocess it by running the `data_preprocessing.py` script:

```bash
python scripts/data_preprocessing.py --raw_data_input_dir data/raw --processed_data_output_dir data/processed --num_features 20 --clustering_threshold 0.5
```
This script processes each CSV file in the input folder, performs feature engineering, selects relevant features while addressing feature correlation, handles missing values, and saves the processed data.

## Model Training

To train machine learning models and create a voting classifier, use the `train_models.py` script:

```bash
python scripts/train_models.py --processed_data_input_dir data/processed --trained_models_output_dir models --metric_choice accuracy --n_splits 10 --voting soft
```
This script processes each CSV file individually, trains several machine learning models, performs hyperparameter tuning, combines the best models into a voting classifier, and saves the trained voting classifier for each league.

## Upcoming Matches Acquisition

To acquire the next football matches data and update the team names, run the `acquire_next_matches.py` script:

```bash
python scripts/acquire_next_matches.py --get_teams_names_dir data/processed --next_matches_output_file data/next_matches.json
```
This script will:

- Fetch the next matches data from the [football-data.org API](https://www.football-data.org/).
- Read the unique team names from the processed data files.
- Update the team names in the next matches data using the mapping file.
    - This step is necessary because the teams' names acquired with the [football-data.org API](https://www.football-data.org/) differ from the teams' names acquired from [football-data.co.uk](https://www.football-data.co.uk/), which've been used to train the ML models. 
- Save the updated next matches to a JSON file.

### Setu up the API_KEY 

In order to properly execute the `acquire_next_matches.py` script it is first necessary to set up the API_KEY to gather the next matches information. Below the procedure on how to properly set up the variable:

1. **Register for an API Key:**
   - Go to the [Football-Data.org website](https://www.football-data.org/) and register to get your personal API key.

2. **Create a `~/.env` File:**
   - This file will be used by the `load_dotenv` library to set up the `API_FOOTBALL_DATA` environment variable.
   - To create the file:
     - Open your terminal and run the command: `vim ~/.env`
     - This will create a new `~/.env` file if it doesn't already exist.

3. **Insert the API Key:**
   - After running the `vim` command, press the `i` key (for "insert mode").
   - Write down the following line, replacing `your_personal_key` with your actual API key:
     - `API_FOOTBALL_DATA=your_personal_key`

4. **Save and Exit:**
   - Press the `Esc` key to exit insert mode.
   - Then, type `:wq!` and press `Enter` to save the changes and exit the editor.

5. **Verify the Variable:**
   - To check if the variable has been properly set, run the following command from the terminal:
     - `cat ~/.env`
   - You should see the `API_FOOTBALL_DATA` variable listed with your API key.

## Making Predictions

To predict the outcomes for upcoming matches and generate a formatted message for sharing, run the `make_predictions.py` script:

```bash
python scripts/make_predictions.py --models_dir models --data_dir data/processed --output_file final_predictions.txt --json_competitions data/next_matches.json
```
This script will:

- Load the pre-trained models and the processed data.
- Make predictions for upcoming matches based on the next matches data.
- Format the predictions into a redable `.txt` message and save it to the specified output file.

## Supported Leagues

For the moment, the team name mapping has been done manually. The predictions currently support the following leagues:

- *Premier League*: **E0**
- *Serie A*: **I1**
- *Ligue 1*: **F1**
- *La Liga (Primera Division)*: **SP1**
- *Bundesliga*: **D1**

For this reason be carful when executing the [data acquisition](#data-acquisition) step.
